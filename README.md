# SpaceRover Mission Control

A full-stack monitoring sandbox for the "Advanced Full Stack Monitoring Course with New Relic." This application provides a comprehensive environment for learning and demonstrating monitoring concepts including APM, Infrastructure, and Logs.

## 🚀 Application Overview

SpaceRover Mission Control simulates a space agency's mission control center that monitors and controls a fleet of rovers exploring distant planets. The application is designed to demonstrate various monitoring concepts in a practical, engaging way.

### Components

1. **Mission Control Dashboard (Frontend)**: React application for visualizing rover status and mission data
2. **Fleet Command Service (Backend API)**: Node.js/Express service for rover command and mission management
3. **Telemetry Processor (Background Service)**: Worker service for processing incoming rover data
4. **Mission Database**: MongoDB database storing mission and rover information
5. **Monitoring Tools**: Tools to observe and analyze application performance

## 🎓 Educational Features

- **Built-in Monitoring**: Pre-configured for New Relic integration
- **Realistic Telemetry**: Simulated rover data that changes over time
- **Structured Logs**: Various log formats and patterns for log monitoring demonstrations
- **Progressive Complexity**: Components can be introduced gradually as students progress
- **Complete Documentation**: Each component includes details about monitoring opportunities

## 📊 Monitoring Concepts Demonstrated

| Course Module | Application Component | Learning Opportunities |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Advanced APM | Fleet Command Service | Transaction tracing, custom instrumentation, change tracking |
| Infrastructure Agent | Docker containers + Host metrics | Infrastructure monitoring, resource utilization, agent configuration |
| Logs | Application-wide logging | Log parsing, patterns, integration with APM and Infrastructure |

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ for frontend, v23+ for backend services if running locally)
- [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) (free tier available)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spacerover-mission-control.git
   cd spacerover-mission-control
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your New Relic license key:
   ```
   NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=your_license_key
   ```

3. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Mission Control Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
   - Fleet Command API: http://localhost:4000
   - Telemetry Service: http://localhost:6000

### Manual Development Setup

If you prefer to run components individually for development:

1. Start MongoDB:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d mongodb
   ```

2. Start the Fleet Command service:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Start the Telemetry service:
   ```bash
   cd telemetry
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## 🔍 Using the Application

### Rover Dashboard

The main dashboard shows an overview of all rovers, their status, and telemetry data. From here you can:

- View rover status and health metrics
- Navigate to detailed views for each rover
- See alerts for critical conditions
- Monitor real-time telemetry updates



### New Relic Integration

The application includes detailed instructions for connecting to New Relic:

1. Navigate to the "New Relic" tab in the application
2. Follow the step-by-step guide to configure your New Relic account
3. Use the provided dashboards and alert configurations
